      <p>Hello, It's me<br />I was wondering if after all these weeks you'd like to meet<br />To go over some updates</p>
      <p><em>Ahem</em>, anyways here's a few little tweaks and a new feature:</p>

      <div class="featured-section">
        <div class="featured-header">
          <h2>Feature(s)</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Static Playlists</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Due to a request I've added an option for Static Playlists. This works just like the static sidebar to force the playlists (right menu) to always be open rather than hidden under a menu icon.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Just like with static sidebar, I had to rearrange a bunch of items, so there's a good chance something might break/not look right. Feel free to let me know and I'll try and fix them up.</p>

          <h2>Updates</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Stylish!</h3>
          <p class="text-center">I apologize to anyone who has used the Stylish/User Styles version of Play Midnight. I've neglected you, and I'm sorry.</p>
          <p class="text-center">I'm updating the Stylish sheets for both (Play Midnight and Play Sunset) so if you favor Firefox or Safari, that should help. Expect this within the next few days.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Play Midnight (Stylish)<br /><a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/115630/play-midnight-for-google-play-music" target="_blank">https://userstyles.org/styles/115630/play-midnight-for-google-play-music</a></p>

          <h2>Bugs</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Queue Track Titles</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Those pesky track titles in the queue should now properly show up in white rather than hiding themselves.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Props to <a href="https://github.com/L-P" target="_blank">LÃ©o Peltier</a> for tackling this one for me!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Track List Play Button</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Fixed issue with the play button going incognito and deciding not to show up anywhere. Solved!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Fixed a few smaller styling issues I saw throughout. Loading indicators and such.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
