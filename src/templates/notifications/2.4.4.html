      <p>Now this is a story all about how<br />Our lives got flipped-turned upside down<br />And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there<br />And I'll tell you all about some things I tried to repair.</p>
      <p><em>Aww</em>, here it goes:</p>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Larger Song Table</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Due to a request I've added an option for Larger Song Table. This gives you the ability to switch back to the larger song rows instead of the tiny ones that Google introduced a few days ago.</p>
          <p class="text-center">There is a slight chance that the rating (thumb up/down) buttons might be broken, so if that's actually a thing, please let me know and I'll try and find a better solution.</p>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Queue Song Indicators</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Fixed the issue with the song playing equalizer and play buttons being too big with the smaller song rows in the mini-queue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Mini-Queue & Static Playlists Bug</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Forgot to test the mini-queue when I was making the "Static Playlists" option and realized it was hidden. Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="featured-content">
          <h3>Recent Activity Background Bug</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Fixed a bug I didn't account for on the Recent Activity when making the images larger. Had to do with user generated playlists not having a single image, but rather being multiple album covers.</p>
